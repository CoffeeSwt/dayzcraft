Introduction
The modification adds general (aerobic) stamina and sleep mechanics to the game.

The purpose of the modification is to make the character's stamina close to real life.
The vanilla stamina mechanic allows the character to run continuously for hundreds of kilometers without consequences, with the character sprinting most of the way.
In the new modified mechanics, sprinting is a valuable resource that must be used wisely in the right situations.

Short list of what consumes or affects rate of consumption of general stamina:
* Character movement type;
* Slope of terrain;
* Type of surface (road, grass, forest, etc.);
* Character load weight;
* Character clothing;
* Climbing, jumping, rolling;
* Stone, planks mining, logging;
* Building;
* Character is hot;
* Character sleep level;

Information for those who suffer
With this modification, you will have to completely rethink your playing style, you need to experience the modification before making any conclusions.

For example, how often do you run with a load of 50 kg in real life? It used to be a common thing in this game - now you will have to keep track of your load weight.

Make sure the character doesn't get too hot, as in this state general stamina is depleted twice as fast.

Avoid sprinting, as sprinting consumes 15 times more stamina than jogging!

There is also no need to run uphill, as the slope of terrain greatly affects stamina consumption. It is better to walk uphill. How often in real life do you run uphill with loading weight of 50 kg?

If you like to move with large load weight - use walking (double LEFT CTRL), if the load weight is less than 50 kg, when walking, general stamina is not spent, but only restored, but even with weight of more than 50 kg, it is not spent much.

And always remember: knowing certain rules - everything will be fine. These are rules from real life.
