Epic skies for your apocalyptic pleasure! Simple re-texture mod, although heavily tweaked cloud and speed values. This is a cloudy mod, with less clear skies.

**UPDATE**

With the incoming changes from 1.23 looking to break all current modded skyboxes, I'm still deciding what to do with this and whether I can be assed to port this particular texture set.

Still, it's been repacked to oblivion and its going to be up to server owners to sort it out.


You may still not re-use or dissemble the textures in this mod in any shape or form, until I release em.
