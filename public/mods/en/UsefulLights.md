Make night fun with viable light sources!

This mod increases the radius of all light sources in the game and dramatically increases the illumination time for RoadFlares, Torches, LongTorches, and Chemlights.

If you think roadflares, chemlights and other items in the game take up slightly too much room in your inventory then check out ItemSizeTweak.
