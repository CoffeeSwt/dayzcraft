**UPDATE**
Removed 'temp fix' for BIs messup with 1.18.. all works properly now.
Changed to vanilla notication system when finding stuff.
If you get errors about STATICFIX, you’ll need to remove that PBO manualy,
Steam is supposed to remove it but sometimes doesn’t.

Currently this is for Chernarus, Livonia, and DeerIsle only. more maps to come! ALL MAPS!
Allows up to 40 custom items to be found, meaning you can use ANY item from other mods as well!

Make sure not to cut yourself when searching the trash, use gloves!
And a mask might help with the revolting stench

NEW:

Now will find custom placed garbage bins using bldr_ Items.

Added server config into the server profile folder.
