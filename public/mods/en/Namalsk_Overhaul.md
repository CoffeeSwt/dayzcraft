NAMALSK MAP OVERHAUL

This is a FREE map edit for Namalsk.

38 custom locations, nothing crazy just to populate the map a little better.

The edits are to help with player survival, exploration, base building and personalized server mods and feel.
This mod will also help with compatibility from every mod setup from steam dayz's workshop and its tier system and category system.
Loot now spawns on ships etc, Everywhere it should with a better loot rebalance a mixture of Dayz vanilla loot placement and Sumrak's system of Namalsk.

The locations are from current location extensions to entire new undiscovered area's of the map, (Places you would not usually venture due to no content)
There is nothing crazy in this mod everything fits nicely with Namalsk.
The Airfield will be done in a separate mod for those who know how Keen I am with my map edits.
