What Is This?

This mod adds 20+ new crafting and action sounds to the game.

In a recent DayZ update the devs added a new can opening sound when opening beans and other canned foods, so I hijacked that new feature to add a bunch of new recipe sounds.

Watch the YouTube video attached to this workshop publication to see a few examples.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.
