What Is This?

This mod adds the ability to pack tents into a backpack to wear on the player's back for nomads, hermits, hunters and RPers.

Basically this is like my Large Tent Backpack mod, except with this mod you can pack any tent into the bag instead of just the Large Tent - and take your home with you! Who said survivors can't be dreamers?

To pack a tent into a backpack just hold the tent bag in your hands and look at any packed tent. To unpack a tent, hold the bag in your hands. The tent bags spawn into the world like any other bag.

You can only turn packed tents into backpacks, and to remain balanced (and because I couldn't figure out how to add it) the tent bag has no cargo slots - but it does contain a Tripod and Camo Net attachment so you can bring your camp with you as well. The bag will add the weight of the tent + attachments, so don't expect to run very fast if you're carring a large tent.

This mod is not perfect and this is a very hacky way to add this functionality and there are some minor animation bugs when equipping the bag onto your back, but after testing for several weeks on my personal servers I haven't encountered any major issues and feel comfortable releasing this publicly for other servers to enjoy.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server's root directory, add it to your launch parameters, and make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys.

Don't forget to add the types.xml entries and modify your quantities & camo types according to your server (there are winter/desert/camo variants etc).

This mod must be installed on both the server & client.

NOTE: This mod is NOT compatible with the Large Tent Bags mod and this mod will conflict with my Large Tent Bag mod. Only run one or the other, not both.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. The source code for this mod (and all my mods) is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Enjoy!
