Its a simple match. What does it do?

It enables you to get a single match from a matchbox, normally a matchbox contains 100 so you could get 100 matches ( I reduced the max amount to 50).

Doing so will drop the single match on the floor and reduce the remaining pieces in the matchbox by 1. The single match can be ignited by any item that can ignite stuff.

The single match burns about 30 secs. It provides some light and can be used to ignite items.

Afterwards its ruined and can´t be re-ignited. While burning you can´t put in into your inventory.

Thats only possible when not burning - when it hasn´t been ignited yet or when its ruined. You can only ignite items if the match is burning.

This adds realism and enables for fast light sources and firestarter options.


Added a candle that can be ignited. The candle burns for 30 mins. The candle can be placed.

You can also blow out the match and the candle, the match can´t be re-ignited, the candle can.

Added the vanilla Petrol Lighter as a light source. Every use drains the fuel a bit.
