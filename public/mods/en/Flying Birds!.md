**NEW**
Added config to disable birds from spanwing over bodies..
allows you to use the bird objects as props thru out the map
with out haveing them enabled on bodies.
**NOTE** you will need to remove your current config for this to take effect.


Now you can track your kill by checking the sky for birds flying over head of a dead body or animal!
Birds will only hover around dead players or animals NOT inside of a building OR too close to other birds.
Birds will leave the area if the body is no longer present.

You can now set a delay for creation and removal of birds for animals and players.
Config is found in server Profile under FlyingBirds
Delay = Seconds X 1000 = Delay in Mins.
EXAMPLE Delay = 300,000 = 5 Mins.

KNOWN ISSUES:
Sometimes when victoms die at the same time, the same birds are created..


TODO:
Add server config to adjust delay time before birds apear.

Add more animated flapping birds.
Add birds to forest that will be startled and fly upwards when a player or animal is near.

Please report any issue you come across!
This is still a WIP!
