BuilderItems is a mod that allows server owners to have a much wider range of options when placing details on the map.

This is not the editor itself, but a mod to give you more options with the editor! You still need to download and use community offline mode. Watch the video.

This is NOT a server side mod only. It needs to be loaded on all clients connecting to the server. It needs to be loaded on the server for the items to show up.

For editing only: In order to get names of items already on the map you need to install this now: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1570627596. Do not use it on client or server, only for offline mode.

Currently, Builder gives about ~1700 props, walls, roads, map objects, etc etc proper class configurations so that owners may use them as decoration or design of their map.

If you're just a player, all you have to do, is hit subscribe and forget about it, this mod doesn't really change anything as far as you're concerned.

For server owners, here's a guide on how to use this to increase your options when editing the map, and a guide on how to use COM for placing objects in general: https://youtu.be/2KX2tRTO-ag

BuilderItems is built into DayZ Expansion. Do not load this mod if you're using Expansion!

Anyone who wants to repack this mod into their server mod, I give you full permission to do so, as this is such a basic mod. Can be used on monetized servers as well.
