Why does a T-Shirt that does not have pockets have 12 slots???
It doesn't make sens.

Realistic Inventory Space is a simple mod that reduces the ammount of slots of pretty much every tops, pants and backpacks in the game.
It is also inspired a lot by how inventory slots were in 0.62, as some of the clothes now have a more "horizontal" layout (like the Riders Jacket for exemple).

I also changed the size of the Gas Canisters, as well as the Gas Stove.
They were all the same size and required some balancing.

It might need further balancing, if you have any feedback, leave a comment!
