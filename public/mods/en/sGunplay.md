What is sGunplay

sGunplay is the second module of the much more ambitious sUDE project.
Its main goal is to give a slightly more hardcore and different experience, but carefully balanced to don't make it feel much different from the vanilla game, while improving the PvP (and PvE) in many aspect.

Key aspects and reasons of the mod

The current DayZ gunplay feels too fast and arcade, with sGunplay I try to fix that problem (Keep in mind that it still lacks some core features, therefore it doesn't completely represent the final vision I have for the gunplay)
sGunplay incentives a more thought-out and slightly slower PvP.
Running and shooting, rushing enemies while hipfiring and other things that make the game feel like an arcade-type shooter, are less rewarding
Your inventory now plays a big role in recoil control, precision and weapon handling. Think twice what weapon to use and what stuff you really need to bring with you when going to PvP hot zones (the sClothing module, with layered clothing, redesigned inventory slots and more, will majorly modify this aspect, so stay tuned)
A more dynamic and always different PvP, thanks to the many features added.



Differences from vanilla DayZ

Less arcadeish gameplay
sGunplay rewards a slower paced PvP/PvE
Slower AimingDownSight (ADS) time, less snappy, robotic and arcadey animation (procedural ADS times will come with future updates)
"Focus" mechanic. Holding your breath will help you focus while in ADS, giving less sway and more precision. The focus speed will change based on the player stance
Reduced FieldOfView while aiming ADS, which combined with the new "focus" mechanic incentivate the player to think twice before shooting

Procedural weapon inertia
No more insane 360Â° flicks with a 5kg weapon, thanks to the new dybamic inertia system based on:
Weapon weight
Inventory weight
Player stance (erect, crouched, prone)
Movement speed
Hipfire (inertia will be much stronger while hipfiring)
Player injury state

Procedural weapon recoil
The weapon recoil system has been remade from scratch, which allowed me to make it more realistic, visually more appealing and more dynamic, based on:
Attachments (more to come in the future)
Character strength (vanilla softskill you see when you open the inventory)
Player stance (erect, crouched, prone)
Inventory weight
Movement (you'll be able to control recoil much better while standing still)
Hipfire (while hipfiring you won't be able to control the recoil very easily)

Completely reworked player cameras
Deadzone! It is also possible to tweak the deadzone strength as you wish
"PictureInPicture" (PiP) emulation. The mangifying optic lens effect has received a major overhaul to better emulate the dual render technic used by games like Insurgency or EscapeFromTarkov. And it also is compatible with deadzone!
The camera is not "tied" to the weapon anymore
Customizable DepthOfField while ADS
It's possible to Freelook while ADS (only with ironsights and non-magnifying optics)
It's possible to visually inspect the weapon (only with ironsights and non-magnifying optics)

Dynamic crosshair
The dynamic crosshair is inspired from the .62 version of DayZ. Such crosshair would help you while hipfiring, showing you where your gun is point at; so it will be much easier to understand if you're shooting a tree or the enemy behind it .
It can be enabled/disabled from the menu settings
Servers can decide to disable it by toggling the crosshair options in the serverDZ.cfg

Improved sway and stamina drain
The weapon sway (caused by the breathing) is a lot more predictable and much easier to control (without crazy spasm from your character).
Holding your breath will drain your stamina a bit slower than vanilla. This has been done to compensate the "time" you need to focus, while also making the timing more plausible, gameplay and realism wise

Other additions
You will slightly retract your weapon before lifting it up when you're close to hit a wall. It will help you a lot during CQB!

Modding
How to make a weapon compatible
- If you use vanilla recoils for your modded weapon, there is nothing you have to do!
- If instead you use a custom recoil and want to make it compatible with sGunplay you may need to specify some more values.
Come in the DISCORD[discord.gg] for a more detailed guide

How to make an optic compatible
All you have to do is to change the PPMaskProperties and PPLensProperties inside your config.cpp.
In both cases the X and Y position must be set to 0.0
