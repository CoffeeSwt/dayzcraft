This mod requires SimpleSpawner!

This mod removes all interactive fuelpumps from the game. (from all Maps!)
And it adds back a variety of few interactive fuelpumps, each with his own gasoline volume.

Included in the download are 3 config examples to replace all 87 fuelpumps from Chernarus or all 28 fuelpumps from Livonia and 65 from DeerIsle with random fuel volumes for each Server restart.

With the SimpleSpawner you can spawn these pumps randomly scattered all over the map at every restart.
There are some that spawn immediately empty or some that have only a few liters.
But there are also some fuelpumps that can refill your gasoline canister completely.

This mod Ideally can be used if you want to make the fuel on the server rare, or to make the gasoline more valuable.

With almost empty gas stations, maybe one or two players think about whether they should drive with the car, or better go walk by foot.

Important! For your information!!!
These fuelpumps are out of service! the scavenging of the remaining amount of fuel out of the pumps can be done only by manual suction or pumping.
The whole procedure can takes much longer than normally, it depends how much fuel can fit in your item!
