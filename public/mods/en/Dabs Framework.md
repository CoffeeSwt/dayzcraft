Dabs Framework is an Open Source, lightweight modding framework, designed to give modders and server owners tools to quickly and effectively create new mods for the community.

The only gameplay feature that DF adds is Dabbing to the emote wheel, otherwise it does not change gameplay whatsoever. It does include a Model View Controller system for creating quick UIs, an Event Manager (originally made for Namalsk, now ported here) and several other small but helpful tools.
