**UPDATE**
Removed 'temp fix' for BIs messup with 1.18.. all works properly now.
Changed to vanilla notication system when finding stuff.


TODO (COMING SOON!):
Add custom wrecks, including boats and air crafts.
---------------------------------------------------

Adds the ability to salvage parts (using a wrench) and fuel from wrecks on the map, can also siphon fuel from active cars.
Some fuel is lost when siphoning.
Adds the ability to refill containers at the Medium fuel tanks with ladders, and as a side not, take caution as they also explode with more force than the fuel pumps.
FIXED: no longer able to refill containers at ruined pumps.

PRO TIP: Its is advisable to bring two containers with you when siphoning fuel, you can not siphon into a container that already has liquid in it. You will need to empty the container or pour liquid into a larger container to save it. Be careful not to swallow any fuel and make sure to wear gloves when salvaging parts, you don't want to get busted knuckles.

Currently this is for Both vanilla maps UPDATED: for DeerIsle ALL MAPS!
