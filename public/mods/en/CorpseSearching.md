CorpseSearching
To see items in a corpse, you have to search it first.
The [+] icon is removed, pointing at any item that you do not know until you look at its inventory.

In this mod there is a configuration file (STCConfig.json) located at the path $profile:/ModConfigs/.

The "AddTimeForEachItem" parameter enables the additional time for each item when searching the body. You can enable or disable it. Enabled by default.
The parameter "TimeForEachItem", is for how many seconds to add to a search for each item in a corpse, works if the "AddTimeForEachItem" parameter is enabled. By default it is 2 seconds.
The parameter "DefaultTimeToSearchPlayer" is for how many seconds will the search of a player's corpse last. By default, it will take 10 seconds.
The parameter "DefaultTimeToSearchZombie" is for how many seconds will the search a zombie corpse. The default is 3 seconds.
