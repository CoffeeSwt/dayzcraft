View Inventory Animation

This mod enables a animation while the player is in inventory.

You can disable the animation being played on the controlled player. This does not stop the animation from being played for other players. Other players will still be able to see when you are in inventory due to the animation being played from them no matter if you disabled it locally for your own player.

You can disable the animation being played in the player preview in inventory.

Server owners
At startup the mod will generate a config file called via.json in your profiles folder.
You can edit this file to force the animation being played locally for players or in the player preview in inventory even if they disabled it as well as a delay time that the player must have the inventory open before the animation starts playing.
