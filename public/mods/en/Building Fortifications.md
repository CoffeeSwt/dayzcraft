CREATED BY DUMPGRAH, THE BUILDING FORTIFICATION MOD ADDS COMPLETE NEW MODELS AND CRAFTING RECIPIES TO THE DAYZ BASEBUILDING FEATURE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT MAP BUILDINGS FORTIFYING ITS DOORS AND WINDOWS. IS AN INTERMEDIATE (AND COMPLEMENTARY) ALTERNATIVE TO THE VANILLA BASEBUILDING SYSTEM (EVEN COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER MODDED SYSTEMS) THAT OFFERS A MORE ORGANIC ALTERNATIVE WHILE ENRICHING THE ORIGINAL EXPERIENCE.
 
IS COMPOSED MAINLY OF TWO MAJOR ELEMENTS:
1) WINDOWS BARRICADE
2) DOOR BARRICADE

ðŸ”¨ General Features â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’

THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS IS QUITE INTUITIVE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE METHOD USED IN VANILLA CONSTRUCTIONS. EACH PART OR PORTION OF A WINDOW OR DOOR BARRICADE WILL REQUIRE A NUMBER OF ITEMS FOR ITS CONSTRUCTION, WHICH ARE DETAILED IN THE INFOGRAPHICS PRESENT IN THIS MOD.
 
BOTH THE DURABILITY, THE METHOD OF DESTRUCTION AND ITS HEALTH VALUE CAN BE CUSTOMIZED AS I ACCOMPANY A CUSTOM FILE THAT YOU CAN FIND AND ADD TO YOUR SERVER, AS WELL AS AN EXPLANATORY DOCUMENT OF ITS OPERATION.

ðŸ”¨ Upcoming developments â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’â€’

THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF MY IDEAS TO OFFER AN ORGANIC AND COMPLEMENTARY ALTERNATIVE TO VANILLA BASEBUILDING IN ORDER TO SECURE STATIC BUILDINGS AROUND THE MAP (CHERNARUS, LIVONIA OR ANY OTHER COMMUNITY MAP). YOU CAN FOLLOW ME ON DISCORD OR TWITTER TO BE MORE INFORMED ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEWS.
