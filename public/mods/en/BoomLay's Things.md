The idea behind this mod was to create craftable furniture that makes sense. That's why most things revolve around a simple wooden pallet, because it's great for building furniture yourself.
The wooden pallet can be found by players or crafted by themselves. In addition, the pallet can be broken down into Planks and nails.

A lot of other things have come up around this idea, have a look at this feature-list:

Features of this Mod:

- Craftable furniture and storage.
- Decorative items like plants, and paintings.
- Items with cool mechanics, like:
a working fridge,
a working rain collector
advanced crafting on the workbench
improved repairing with a repair bench
a Solarpanel
some new lamps
indoor stove
personal storage - available at every deposit point
a coffee and a snack vending machine for traders
a cool storage for wooden logs or firewood
a trashcan
a greenhouse
...
- many config possibilities
- an integrated spawning system, that can also ignite spawned fireplaces (like BarrelHoles or my static version of the stove barrel).

Information for Players - CRAFTING:

Have a look at this list to see what you need for crafting:

Crafting List.

Crafting may be disabled by your server owner.

Other Items:

The indoor plants, the paintings and the carpets are NOT craftable.



Information for Players - DISMANTLING:

Wooden Pallets can be dismantled to gather Planks and Nails. The amount you get and the Tools you need may vary depending on the server settings.
Default Tools are: Hatchet, Wood Axe, Firefighter Axe, Crowbar, Pickaxe
Default outcome: 6 Planks and 20 Nails

By default you can use a screwdriver or pliers to dismantle furniture - but your server owner can configure the possible tools.

If crafting is enabled, dismantling will always return the crafting Kit. Whether or not you get the materials back depends on the configuration of the server owner.

If crafting is disabled, you will always get a prefab Kit in form of a cardbox.

To dismantle the greenhouse, you need to be inside the greenhouse and aim at the middle of the greenhouse (with tool in hand).


Information for Server Owners:

There are a lot of things in this mod, that you can configure. Have look at this Guide to get all possibilities explained:

BL_Things Config Guilde

The directory 00_Info in the mod files, contains an example types.xml and a Delta-Version of the latest Update.

You can also find a sample configuration of the recipes for the Expansion Book in the same folder.

There is an integrated spawning system to spawn Items ( see config guide ). You can also use this to autoignite everything that is based on a fireplace.

"Static" Items ( not for players ) in this Mod:
bl_large_depot
Large deposit point where Players can access their personal deposit container.

bl_small_depot
The small version of a deposit point - in case you don't have that much space available.

bldr_bl_wooden_lantern
A wooden lantern, that can be placed via editor/admintool/trader or my own spawning system.
Use this lantern to illuminate places like your trader. The light of the lantern doesn't cast shadows.
If you need light in an area with artificial Darkness, use the "..._DAY" version of the lantern.

bl_snackomat_TRADER
A little fun-object... players can buy a random snack at this snack vending machine.
Works with Trader by Jones, TraderPlus and Expansion Market.

bl_coffee_machine_TRADER
A trader version of my coffee machine. Players can buy a cup of coffee at it.
Works with Trader by Jones, Trader Plus and Expansion Market.

BarrelHoles_bl_stove
Previously this version of my stove barrel was ment to be spawned and ignited by trader mods.
This is why it's called "BarrelHoles", because I had to fake a Barrel for this.
Now you should spawn this stove via my integrated spawning system and set "autoignite" to "1".
