Description
This mod makes you unable to eat/drink from any source(be it any type of food or drinking from lake, pan, etc, it should affect everything) when using any sort of item on your face slot.
Found out it also works for pills, unless it's someone giving you then it doens't.

This mod should be very basic and should probably affect items from other mods since it overrides the base item AllowFoodComsumption() function by just making it return false instead of true.

Tested locally and on namalsk nightmare server, if something needs to be fixed hit me up on the comments or anywhere else.
