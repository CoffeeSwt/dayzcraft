Description

Adds a PDA to the game, through which players can communicate with text messages.

To communicate with a player, you need to add him as a friend by name or ID. So you need to meet with the player in the game for know his name.

Global channel is present and can be enabled by server owner.

Messages can be written only to online players.

The history of messages and contacts is stored on the client side, which does not load the server. This is good optimized and very lightweight mod.
