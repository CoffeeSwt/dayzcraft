Ear Plugs allow you to lower and toggle your sound effect volume so you can hear VOIP easier. Perfect for driving, or flying.

What does it do?
Ear Plugs allows you to lower your volume via a rebindable key to a custom set level which you can then toggle on and off. While EarPlugs is active there will be a small icon on the left side of the screen to let you know that your sound level is being modified. When changing the audio level up and down a new number showing the audio value (In percent) will be displayed before fading out - The default audio level reduces all sound effects by 80%.
