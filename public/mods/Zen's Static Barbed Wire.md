What Is This?
This mod makes non-player placed barbed wire dangerous by adding Barbed Wire damage zones to them which act like player-placed barbed wire.

If a player walks into these 'static' barbed wire objects they will be cut and their clothes will be damaged.

Check out the attached video to see what I mean.

There is a JSON config that allows you to specify damage zones for various game objects, including how often they damage the player.
