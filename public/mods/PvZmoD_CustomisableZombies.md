Side features
Day/Night Time :
You can modify the beginning and the end hour of the night (default vanilla values are not very consistent in my opinion). This only affect the time when characteristics switch from day to night (and night to day) it does not affect server speed day/night times.

Fist fighting :
It is very easy to fight zombies with fist so I added a little damage and a chance to bleed during fist fighting (not to death of course) when player fist fight without glove and gloves degradation when player does wear gloves. This option is of course fully customisable and deactivable.

Modifications in cpp files :
(can't be modified without repacking)
- Zombies does not attack the animals (except for bears and wolves which relationships are customisable).
- Zombies inventory size increased.
- Zombies mask and eyes slots activated.
- Zombies are less easily attracted by the impact of bullet and the shots with suppressor
(and the durability of the suppressors have been increased).

Other :
- Zombies can break closed doors that are not locked with a lockpick.
- Crushing zombies with cars damage vehicle radiator.
- Zombies can hit the stopped cars.
- Crossbow oneshot if zombies are shot in the head.
- Helmets protect zombies from headshots.
- Player's heavy attacks can hit many zombies at the same time.
- Zombies can hit players on obstacle like cars (and sometime through buildings windows)
- Zombies can throw stones on player who are on obstacle.
- Bear traps make zombies crawling if they are not killed by it.
- WW are friendly.
- This mod can be use to modify zombies from another mod (but you have to test, it doesn't work for some creatures, Look at the list here).
- Each key feature can easily be deactivated independently.
- These is « global factors » to easily modify main characteristics for all zombies at once.
