Take your DayZ survival to new depths with the Multi-Level Underground Bases Mod! This mod introduces a revolutionary concept, allowing you to build underground shelters with three distinct levels of upgrades.




Three Levels of Upgrades: Journey underground to craft your covert underground base across three distinct levels. Each level serves a unique purpose, from additional storage area to living quarters and beyond!

Strategic Advantage: Exploit the tactical opportunities offered by your multi-level underground base for observation, ambushes, and secure gear storage.

Personalization: Tailor each level to your preferences, whether it's for sleeping quarters, storage rooms, crafting areas, hatch camouflage, or even underground gardens.

Enhanced Security: Fortify your multi-level fortress with a code lock or combination lock!
