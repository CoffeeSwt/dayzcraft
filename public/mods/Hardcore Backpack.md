Hardcore Backpack is a mod that aims to make the use of a backpack a bit more difficult...

While the backpack is on your back you can:
- No longer fully access your backpack.
- Freely use and quickbar only your backpack attachments.
- Pick up items into your backpack.

In order to manage your backpack's inventory, you will have to either hold it in your hands or drop it on the ground. Consequently, you will have to enter fights prepared or risk consequences for nothing having what you need at the ready.

Unpacking, repacking, copying files is not allowed under any conditions.
Unpacking is allowed only if your only intent is learning! Although in this mod, there isn't too much to learn from :D

Why do I not allow repacking?
Well...simply put, if people repack all the mods into their server mods, then there's a high chance your players will have to redownload content they already have! It doesn't make your server any faster at all when you repack mods!

Can I run this mod on a monetized server?
Yes, you can run this mod on your monetized server, but its features are not allowed to be monetized!
