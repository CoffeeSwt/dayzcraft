Give And Take

This mod is in early testing phase. Use at your own risk.

Adds two new sets of actions to the game:
1. Offering and item and a player takes it from you.
2. Another player requests an item and you give it to him.

The default key for offering/requesting an item is "O". If you have an item in your hand you can offer it to another player. If you have no item in hands you can request an item from a player.

Putting items in another players pockets:
Additionally you can unlock your inventory so that other players can put items in your pockts.
In order to toggle the access a hot key needs to be assigned.
If a player has unlocked its inventory a additional action will appear on the player.
