Repairing tents and sleeping bags

The tents and sleeping bags can be repaired by using duct tape & sewing kits. Simply hold duct tape / sewing kit in your hands and there will be an option to repair the item.
Damaged tents and bags can lose the ability to be folded / deployed, make sure that your item is repaired.


An override for the tent and sleeping bag storage can be found here:
